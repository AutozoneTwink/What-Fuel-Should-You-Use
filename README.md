# What-Fuel-Should-You-Use
*Pretty much just go with your manual, unless you've done any engine mods or tuning, or if you've got diesel, or flex-fuel, or have changed stuff around.*

### Octane Grade
To put it simpy, higher octane grade means the gas is able to be compressed more before it detonates. This is why octane ratings are sometimes referred to as the resistance of the gas to knocking. Engine knock is where fuel burns unevenly due to the air/fuel mixture not being correct, this will sound like a high-pitched dinging or rattling (it will not sound good, and you'll very likely know, might even get a CEL). 

##### Fuel Measurements
Depending on where you go in the world there will be one of three measurements used. 

**RON**
###### Research Octane Number
Fuel is run in a test engine at 600 rpm with differing compression ratios to test how much it takes to cause engine knock running certain fuels. This one tends to be the most common.

##### MON
###### Motor Octane Number
Fuel is run at 900 rpm through a test engine with preheated fuel and varied ignition timing to test the fuels knocking. Tends to be 8-12 points lower than RON.

##### AKI
###### Anti-Knock Index
Is the mean between RON and MON, so is often written as (R+M)/2. In Canada, the USA, and Brazil this is the measurement used (feels a little weird for us north americans to not be in the average, huh). 

##### RdON
###### Observed Road Octane Number
Created by testing fuels in "real" (not test) engines in cars at wide open throttle on dynos. This kinda sounds like it'd be a sick job, only issue could be some hurting in the ears, but I doubt I could do much more damage than I already do.

### Which one Should You use
At most pumps you'll have three gasoline options. Regular, mid, and premium. Their average ratings are as shown:
- Regular: 87
- Mid: 89-90
- Premium: 91-94
As well, there'll be diesel and maybe ethanol options. To generalise, if you're car says to use diesel, use it, and if you can use ethanol, it'll be cheaper to. And most cars after 2001 can handle lower (10-15% / E10-E15) ethanol-based fuels but anything higher will likely cause some issues with corrosiveness.

Really don't run diesel in non-diesel or vice versa. The two engines are VERY different in design and one cannot combust fuel designed for the other. Diesel only detonates at a higher compression level, so running gas in it will cause it to knock and detonate in ways its not supposed to.

If your car is pretty much stock you should just go with what your owners manual says. Running higher octane if your car isn't tuned for it wont offer any power improvements, but it will make it a lot less likely that your car will grenade, so its advised that if you're going to track your car you should toss higher octane into it before heading out. A long time ago there used to only be protective and cleaning additives in higher octanes, but with changes to emissions regulations companes add them to all grades (also cus it tends to cut costs).

Unfortunately, if you do decide to make engine modifications to your vehicle you will need to run higher octanes if it changes the ignition timing, compression ratios, or air/fuel mixture. Cars modified with turbos/superchargers should use higher fuel grades in order to prevent engine knock. 

If youve done engine mods you should really get a tune done so that you can perfect it for a certain fuel grade, and youll know for sure what you should be running, which can save you money as you can guesstimate mixtures and try and get somewhere in the middle with a blend of higher and lower octane ratings

There is anoter caveat in that some cars designed to run higher octane grades can recognize the fuel and change timing and still run it (your manual will tell you what it can do, just read that). However, you wont get as good gas mileage or performance with lower octanes because the engine is now running weaker because it doesn't want to detonate the gas early (engine knock again).

##### Modifying to Run Ethanol
Especially lately with the gas prices going up as they are, I keep looking over and seeing E85 at what I used to pay for regular before all this shit (I've even looked into what it costs to engine swap to manual at this point). But I love my car too much to want to deal with all the issues running ethanol on a non flex-fuel build would do. (Note that you can run E85 once or twice if you're in a pinch and you *shouldn't* have any issues).

You can convert any old car to run on alcohol, and will run you more than a few bucks, but you should be able to diy almost all the steps. You'd need to upgrade your fuel pump, injectors, get a tune done, and optional and may or may not be needed to be upgraded are the fule pressure regulator, fuel lines, and fuel pump wiring. 

Changing out parts so you can run E85 is honestly a really solid idea as it works just as well as the highest octanes for anti-knock, and is chaper (also its like green and stuff so ICEs could still have a shot). As well, a couple of the mods you do will add a decent shot of power if you get it tuned to do it right.

Please run the right fuel guys :pleading_face:. 

Also, if you've done this kinda stuff or know something feel free to give me let me hear about it [@uninsuredmotorist](https://www.instagram.com/uninsuredmotorist/) Pretty please :pleading_face:.
